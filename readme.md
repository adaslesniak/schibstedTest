Hi,

In this mini project I didn't focus on UI things at all. If you want to check if I can implement presentation layer you can check my previous works. But they won't show how I code, how I feel code structure. So this project is about later.

The thing here is little experimental. It's my own version of MVP, I personally call it SmartModel/View/Controllers. Anyway - I can use different architectures, but wanted to play with it and use this ocassion to talk about it, let it be criticised, take a chance to improve it.

I made this in about 1.5 days - not real days. I was at home with little kid... And code is definitely unfinished. But I left comments where I think things should be refactored, changed implemented. I believe it's even nicer entry point for discussion.

Sincerely
Adam Lesniak
